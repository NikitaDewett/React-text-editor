The app have text area, where user can write text and three buttons with formatting options.
User can apply all options at the same time.

Clicking on the option will active formatiing mod. For example, clicking on **Bold** button, 
will enable Bold mod, so all text, that will be written, will be bold. 

Options also can be applied for the text which was already written, just by selecting
the text and clicking on the formatting option button.

After user selects a word, he will see a list of synonyms in the modal window. Clicking on the word
from modal, will replace selected word on clicked word from modal (all applied formatting options will be saved).
